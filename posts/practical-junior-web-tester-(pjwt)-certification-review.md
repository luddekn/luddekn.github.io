# Practical Junior Web Tester (PJWT) Certification Review

In early March this year (2024), I managed to pass the Practical Junior Web Tester (PJWT) certification from TCM Security. Leading up to taking this exam, I had a lot of questions surrounding the exam itself and web application penetration testing, and the goal of this little review is to answer a few of those questions I had before taking it, after passing, to potentially guide and help future exam takers on a good path.

_**Disclaimer**: For obvious reasons, this review will not damage or compromise the integrity of the actual PJWT exam, meaning, I will not discuss how I passed my exam attempt or help any exam taker with actually passing the PJWT exam. This is strictly public knowledge with my experience added to it!_

### § PJWT Exam Information

Every certification from TCM Security comes with two (2) exam vouchers, meaning if you fail the first time you have a second attempt to try again.

Upon starting your exam you will receive a Rules of Engagement (RoE) document and also a VPN file to access the exam environment. The RoE will give you all the information you need to know to have a successful exam attempt, so make sure to read it and understand it.

The PJWT certification is a four (4) day practical exam split into two parts. The first part of the exam lasts two (2) days, and within that time, the exam taker needs to successfully exploit various vulnerabilities in a web application. The last part of the exam also lasts two (2) days, and this is where the exam taker presents their findings in a professionally written web application penetration test report.

If you happen to fail as I did on my first attempt (which is totally normal and okay), more on that later, then do not worry, TCM will not just leave you in the dust, they will actually provide a little hint that could push you in the right direction when you go into your second attempt, this is golden!

### § PJWT Target Audience

Before we begin preparing for this exam, let's first discuss who this certification is for. We can’t talk about this certification without also talking about the Practical Bug Bounty (PBB) course provided by TCM Security, which is the study material for the PJWT certification.

This is a beginner-level web application penetration testing certification, meaning it is perfect for anyone wanting to dip their toes into how web application penetration testing works from start to finish. It's also perfect for anyone with web application testing experience who wants to test their skills!

The PBB course goes over a lot of beginner-friendly web application content and covers some web fundamentals, reconnaissance and information-gathering, a variety of different web application attacks found in the OWASP Top 10 list, and finally how to write a professionally written penetration test report. The PBB course is going to be a really solid foundation for you if you simply want to learn about web applications in general!

### § Failed Attempt

Now you are probably asking yourself “Why should I take advice from someone who failed?”, and that’s a fair question to ask, but just hear me out. I’m actually kind of glad I failed on my first attempt, it did not feel good at first, but after giving it a day of thought I looked at it differently.

Any person will and can fail in life and there is no shame in failing, failing is not a failure in my eyes if you can learn from the experience, and what I learned is that this is not a race on how fast you can finish, there is a reason why you have four (4) days, use your time well and take it slow.

Failing also gave me experience of what it is like to fail an exam from TCM Security, which was not like any ordinary exam failure. Instead of being told “Too bad try again”, they actually give you feedback on where to focus on your next attempt since they want you to succeed!

I almost had it with my first attempt, but it did not quite make the cut, which I kind of already knew from the moment I delivered my attempt. The reason for my failed attempt was simply the fact that I was nervous and stressed which made me overlook certain things which I will not discuss.

Take your time, be calm, follow your methodology and you will succeed!

### § My Recommended Preparation

Now, as you have probably guessed, the PBB course from TCM Security is everything you need to be able to prepare for and pass the PJWT exam. The PBB course comes with its own local lab environment where you can practice what you learn which is really awesome!

I would recommend you stick with the course content and that you not only practice with the lab provided, but that you actually understand what it is that you are doing. Understanding not only how to do things practically, but also what to look out for in web applications and how different attacks work behind the scenes is going to help you a lot moving forward.

With that being said, becoming a web application penetration tester does not only require you to exploit web applications, but also requires you to provide remediation tips for the security issues you find during an assessment. I would therefore recommend you to also spend some extra time in your preparation to research how to remediate the different web application vulnerabilities covered in the PBB course.

It might seem hard to remember all of this stuff, and it is to some degree. To help you remember all of this stuff, I would recommend you take good notes along the way. Good notes do not mean noting everything down, it simply means to take notes you can go back to later and understand what you learned at that time. If you are curious, my note structure for the different vulnerabilities looked like this (this is not a perfect solution, the best way is to figure out your own structure):

Explanation/definition of vulnerability.
How does said vulnerability work?
How to find said vulnerability in a web application.
Practical showcase of vulnerability — Including references to online sources containing payloads, etc.
How to remediate vulnerability — Including references to online sources containing remediation tips.
If you are a complete beginner with web applications, web application testing, and web application security, then I would also highly recommend checking out this additional resource from TryHackMe. But keep in mind this resource will not help you pass the exam, it will simply strengthen some fundamental concepts which will be beneficial to have an understanding of:

### § My Advice

Now that you have some knowledge of the exam itself and also how to prepare for it, let me give you some personal advice on how you can be successful during your exam attempt(s).

First of all, take it slow and do not stress, four (4) days is more than enough to be able to successfully find various web application vulnerabilities and also write a professionally written report. With that being said, use your time well but also remember to take breaks and of course sleep!

Second of all, do not try everything at once, what I mean by that is to focus on one vulnerability at a time, if something does not work right away then take a break or move along with another vulnerability. Please remember, that this is a beginner-level web application penetration test certification, which also implies that you should treat it like a beginner-level exam.

Last but not least, one thing I found extremely helpful was writing the report while doing the practical part of the exam, this let me capture the screenshots and information I needed for the report right away which saved a lot of time at least for me. But this does not mean you have to do it, do whatever fits your workflow!

### § Conclusion

The Practical Junior Web Tester (PJWT) certification from TCM Security is a fun, beginner-friendly, but also challenging exam that lasts four (4) days. Its preparation material, namely the Practical Bug Bounty (PBB) course from TCM Security, will cover anything and everything you need to know to be able to pass the PJWT exam. Would encourage anyone interested in web application penetration testing and web application security to have a look at both the PBB and the PJWT, you can find both here:
