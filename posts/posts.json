		"summary": "In early March this year (2024), I managed to pass the Practical Web Pentest Associate (PWPA) certification from TCM Security. Leading up to taking this exam, I had a lot of questions surrounding the exam itself and web application penetration testing, and the goal of this little review is to answer a few of those questions I had before taking it, after passing, to potentially guide and help future exam takers on a good path."
